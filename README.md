RADIATION ENGINE v1.0.0

Top-down, tile-based game engine, designed to be reusable for multiple projects (flexible
loading of tile images, maps, sounds, etc.)

Built with the 5.0.10 build of Allegro

This is still in incredibly early development (started 1/08/2014), so don't expect much for now.

Written and compiled using MSVC++2012 framework, will port once stability and usability is achieved.

TODO:
Audio system
Map loading/parsing
Menus/User interface
Custom content detection using config files
Cross-platform compatibility?
